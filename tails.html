                <p>Miles "Tails" Prower (テイルス Teirusu) is a fictional character in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the title character's best friend and sidekick. Tails also appears in his own spin-off series as "Two Tails" in comic books, cartoons, as well as in an OVA: Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA).  The name "Miles Prower" is a pun on "miles per hour", a reference to the famed speed of Sonic the Hedgehog. He is an eight-year-old fox with two tails, hence the nickname. A mechanical genius, he is able to use his two tails to propel himself like a helicopter. He debuted with the release of the 8-bit version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in October 1992. In the mid-1990s, he was featured as the main character in a number of spinoff games: Tails and the Music Maker for the Sega Pico, and Tails Adventure and Tails' Skypatrol for the Game Gear. According to an official poll from Sega, Tails is the third most popular character of the series, behind Sonic and Shadow.</p>
                <p>The character of Tails is portrayed as a very sweet-natured and humble fox who, before he met Sonic, was often picked on because of his twin tails. Sonic however, saw Tail's unatural talents and cheered him on, causing the fox to have some admiration towards the blue hero. As a long time friend, he admires Sonic and dreams of being just like him. Though he lacks much courage, he wants to prove that he can be counted on, and has fought Dr. Eggman and his robots without the aid of Sonic before. He loves mint candy, tinkering with machines, and flying mechas. Despite overcoming most of his fears and becoming very bold, Tails also has a fear of lightning.  Tails has been described as a mechanical prodigy who rivals Dr. Eggman but has not yet realized his full potential. Additionally, by spinning his two tails like a helicopter rotor, he has the unique ability to push himself through the air[10] to catch up with Sonic. However, when he takes to flight he tires quickly. Unlike Sonic, Tails has the ability to swim. Like Sonic, he can transform into Super Tails, but he requires Super Emeralds to transform. This was seen first as what seemed a one-time appearance in Sonic 3 & Knuckles but then again in Sonic Heroes where alongside Team Sonic members Sonic and Knuckles, would transform themselves into their 'super' forms.</p>
